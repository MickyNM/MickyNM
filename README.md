- 👋 Hi, I’m MickyNM, part of <a href = "https://www.mm-soft.rs/"><b>M&M-soft</b></a>, business and marriage partners, Java programmers who do their work with passion and enjoyment. <br>
I like people, to work with people and help people as much as possible, because a phrase I carry with me is "people need people".
- 🏡 I love being with my family and friends, they are everything to me.
- 👀 I’m interested (in my free time)in drawing, making miniatures from wood and sport fishing.
